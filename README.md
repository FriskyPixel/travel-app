# Travel Weather App

## Overview

This app was created as part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program, and is the capstone project.

The project includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to, and the date you are leaving.

If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast.
